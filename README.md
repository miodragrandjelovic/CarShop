# CarShop


A web application that enables the viewing of car advertisements,
creating and deleting ads. Users after registration
can view advertisements but also create their own. Users can add up to
10 images per ad. Ads of the logged user are shown
on the user profile page. <br />


The frontend was developed in Angular, using Bootstrap for responsivity,
while the backend was developed in Node.js, and MongoDB was used to store user data and car advertisements.
